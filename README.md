# Numerical_Simulations_Confined_Langevin_Equation

This is my PhD code to simulate the Brownian motion confined between two rigid walls.
It is make with 'Python', 'Cython' and I use 'Jupyter Notebook' to analyse datas.

For more informations about the project, 
- you can find my PhD manuscript about this project (french) here :
